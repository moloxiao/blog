If your connection is active but you still can’t access a specific website, the issue might be with your DNS settings. Using NSLOOKUP and Checking the Host File :\nUse the nslookup command to see what IP address your DNS server is assigning to the website name. If nslookup shows the correct IP address but the website still doesn’t load, your computer’s host file might be redirecting the website to a wrong IP address. You can edit the host file to remove any incorrect entries. Importance of Isolation :\nDNS troubleshooting can be tricky, but remember to isolate each component. Systematically checking your network connection, DNS server response, and host file will help you pinpoint and fix the root cause of the problem. Managing System Services Services are programs that run in the background without needing user interaction, providing essential functions like DNS, DHCP, and NTP.\nManaging Services :\nSystem administrators need to know how to start, stop, and check the logs of services to ensure they’re running smoothly.

Once installed, dnsmasq automatically starts with basic DNS caching enabled. This means it can store DNS query results, speeding up subsequent requests for the same domain. While primarily a caching DNS server, dnsmasq can also act as an authoritative server for specific hostnames. By providing dnsmasq with a file listing hostnames and their corresponding IP addresses, it can directly resolve those names without forwarding the query to other DNS servers. dnsmasq as a DHCP server :\nA DHCP server is typically configured on a device with a static IP address on the network interface used to serve DHCP requests. In the simulation, a single machine simulates both the DHCP server (using the eth_srv interface) and a DHCP client (using the eth_cli interface). The dnsmasq configuration file (dhcp.config) specifies the interface to listen on (eth_srv), the domain name, default gateway, and DNS server information for clients. A DHCP range defines the pool of IP addresses the server can assign, and the lease time determines how long a client can use an assigned IP. ",
