  "articleBody": " Failure is not about when you get rejected, failure is when you have the chance but you never tried.\n1 General Interview Questions 1.1 Tell me about yourself I will share four parts of my experience related to this job: 1. my work on IoT projects; 2. my experience with SQL and databases; 3. my background in web development; and 4. my knowledge of the energy sector.\nI created an IoT light product using Socket, ESP8266, and React, and published it to EC2. Additionally, we developed a manufacturing test system that supports GE and Osram IoT projects. This included working with AWS IoT Core, Broadcom chips, and MQTT. SQL and Database: Currently, I am working on a contract to optimize a system, focusing on improving SQL queries. Initially, there were 450 slow queries, and now there are 400. I have optimized some of the critical queries. Additionally, I have written a full-version ERP system, which involves managing complex relationships within the database. Web Development: Currently, my tech stack includes Flask (or Django) for the backend API. For the frontend, I use Next.js and ShadUI for the user interface. 1.2 Why are you interested in this role/company? I am looking for challenging tasks, like managing charging stations. I think there are still many challenges, such as compatibility issues between different manufacturers and IoT security problems. I hope we can find a way to let machines talk to each other.\n1.3 What are your strengths and weaknesses? should not :\nlie about your weaknesses say that you have none try to turn your weaknesses into positive attributes should :\na weakness that is a skill that you can work on examples :\n[joke]Figuring out a satisfying answer to this question. you are an introvert and sometimes you are shy to share your ideas being too creative and not being able to filter your ideas I often pay too much attention to details, which sometimes goes beyond what’s needed and slows me down a bit. I need to learn more from experienced coworkers. When I was a beginner, I felt a bit shy if I had to confirm instructions too many times. 1.4 What are your career goals? I hope that in the next five years, I can find ways to make machines talk to each other on their own. But my small goal for this year is to have AI generate more than 50% of the code I use every day.\n1.5 How do you handle pressure and deadlines? 1.6 Describe a challenging project you worked on and how you overcame obstacles. I can’t find a single book that influenced my life because many books have had an impact on me.\nThere is an issue with a query that takes over 60 seconds to execute, involving the bulk entry of only a few hundred parts into the inventory. One of the tables requires querying over a million records, which can cause the application to run out of memory and lead to data inconsistency. I use batch processing to prevent memory overflow, but the question remains: why query a million records? Is it possible to avoid this query?\nAn additional example related to distributed systems: for instance, a database setup includes 1 master node and 2 slove nodes. Some operations need to complete additional tasks immediately after writing data. If a query is made to the slove nodes right away, the data might not have synchronized yet\n1.7 about visa examples :\n3-year partner work visa expired on July 31, 2027 1.8 Why should I even hire you with no experience in this field I had no experience I was a quick learner and could take coaching, what I will not bring with me is 20 years of bad habits. I can learn to do things the way you want them.\n2 Technical Interview Questions 2.1 Explain a complex technical concept in simple terms. 2.2 Describe your experience with [specific programming language, database, or tool]. 2.3 How would you approach [specific technical problem]? 2.4 Walk us through your development process. 2.5 What are the pros and cons of different programming languages or methodologies? 3 Behavioral Interview Questions 3.1 Describe a time when you had to work as part of a team to achieve a goal. 3.2 Tell me about a time when you failed. What did you learn from it? 3.3 How do you handle conflict with a colleague? 3.4 Give an example of a time when you had to adapt to change. 4 My question 4.1 What are the expectations for this position over the next three months?
